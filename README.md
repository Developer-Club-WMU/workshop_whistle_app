# Getting Started: Whistle App
This app is used for the App Department's workshop on getting started with flutter. It is to help guide people through working on their first basic app. 

The app is broken up into stages to help show the different checkpoints that the app can stop at to be functional; each one builds on the last. 
- **Stage 1**: A single button that plays a sound
- **Stage 2**: Multiple selectable buttons that change the played sound and button color
- **Stage 3**: A slider that changes the sound volume

The version created in the workshop will be built within a single screen; it is only split up here for visualization and understanding purposes.
